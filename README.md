### Yes this repository brings the thrill of scientific research competition to real life!
* Natural Language Processing
* Data visualization
* Machine learning

### Structure
* data mining (mostly _google-scholar_ and _arxiv.org_)
* tokenization (if not in English)
* feature extraction
* syntax analysis, filter only named entity words (stanford nlp)
* semantics analysis, compute the similarity, reduce noise and combine frequency (google word2vec)
* naively and heaustically classify the technologies
* reccomendation of papers, scholars to follow
* visualization of technology tree (map)
* shortest path according to word relation
* yeah you can research accordingly
